# Community Etiquette & Guidelines

Welcome! To ensure the HKUST Anonymous Forum remains a valuable, respectful space, please follow these guidelines.

## 1. Be Respectful

*   Treat others respectfully, even during disagreements. No personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech.
*   Remember each anonymous ID is a community member.

## 2. Contribute Constructively

*   Add value: share insights, ask thoughtful questions, provide relevant information.
*   Stay on topic and avoid spamming or low-effort posts.

## 3. Use Tags Responsibly

*   Choose tags ("Student", "Professor", "Staff") that accurately reflect your perspective for that post/comment.
*   Respect the tag voting system; your tags can be voted on too.

## 4. Protect Privacy

*   Do not try to de-anonymize users.
*   Don't share Personal Identifiable Information (PII) beyond what the anonymous ID system provides.

## 5. Accuracy and Misinformation

*   Strive for accuracy. If you see errors, politely correct them with reasoning if possible.
*   Do not deliberately spread misinformation. The tag voting system helps identify misleading claims.

## 6. University Community Focus

*   Keep discussions relevant to HKUST life (campus, academics, events).
*   Ensure contributions are appropriate for a university setting.

## 7. Moderation (Conceptual)

*   While this demo may lack active moderators, a real deployment would have mechanisms for guideline enforcement.

**By participating, you agree to foster a positive and constructive environment.**

Thank you for your cooperation!
